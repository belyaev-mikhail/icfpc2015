You need Mono and F# under Linux to build this.
The rest should be smooth.

There is the VS2015 project available to look at on Windows.
The WindowsFormsApplication1 thing is my cool (but sloppy) visualizer employing the core of my F# solution.
It's in C# and uses WindowsForms so probably won't work on non-windows system. I really don't know, never used this languages before.
